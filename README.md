Machine Learning: One classification and one regression problem example with linear models

### Abstract

As an assignment for our Machine Learning module in Computer Engineer-ing, we study two data sets with the objective of applying both theory and practice learnt in the module.  With the imposed restriction of only using linearmodels, we take a look at a classification and a linear regression problem and discuss data processing, possible hypothesis sets, out of sample performance evaluation methodology and the effects in our results. We implement -using ML techniques- two  models, one of them able to classify hand-written digits with very good accuracy and the other is able to predict the noise of produced by the windhitting an air vehicle.
